# Pop_OS! Fresh Install
This is a composition of scripts for applications and customization that I personally prefer when starting from fresh.

<h2>Todo</h2>
- Make an automated version w/ little to no errors for desktop.
- Add the cute AmongUs pixel art to it [both desktop & server version]
- Add Hack font install
- Add the JetBrains automated install script to .bashrc/.zshrc file
