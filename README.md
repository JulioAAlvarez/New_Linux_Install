# Fresh Linux/Pop_OS! Install
Hello everyone, thjs a repo containing simple scripts to my frensh installs of Ubuntu based distributions. 
They also contain common visuall customizations I normally do to most of them.


here is a high chance this repo gets remade into a dotfiles page like most other Linux Nerds. They make theirs look rly cool and have their config in one public place to share w/ every one and I also want that. Therfore, I'll also be spending a copiuos amount of time under that one unix subreddit snoping aroung to steal some configs. I will 100% credit them though.


<h2>Pissible Todo Tasks</h2>
- Create a test VM version and see how I can make these scripts more automated.
- Add the JetBrains automated install script to .bashrc/.zshrc file
